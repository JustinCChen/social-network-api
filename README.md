## Social Network

# Description

Social Network API is a server database that allows the user to make get, post, put, and delete requests in order to fully manipulate data. It was made in order to practice MongoDB and Mongoose.

While building this project I learned to:
- Create a noSQL database through MongoDB
- Add virtuals to a model
- Add multiple routes to the same function instead of defining them individually
